## Product Overview

This enables stakeholders to set a minimum amount of SNT that a Status stakeholder must deposit in order for someone outside of their network to contact him directly. If the recipient replies the deposit is forfeited to the recipient.

 ## Product Description

Any Status user can enable Tribute to Talk and set a minimum required deposit for other users to stake in order to send them a message. Users requiring a tribute can whitelist their full contact list, or specific contacts.
 If User A requires a minimum 200 SNT deposit, User B will not be able to open a new chat with User A until they deposit at least 200 SNT. Once deposited, User B can send their message.
 If User A responds to User B’s message, the deposit is transferred to User A, and a conversation is opened.
 If User A does not respond or User B changes their mind, User B can cancel or withdraw the request. The request will also time out automatically if User A does not respond in some number of days. In any case where User A does not respond, the deposit is returned to User B.
 If User A rejects User B’s request, User B’s deposit is returned. User B will have to wait some amount of time before they are able to send a new request to User A.
 
 ## The future
 
 Tribute to Talk is a SNT Use Case part of the set of features inteded to enhance the user experience on the Status app, along with access control to group chats, banning of users via voting, and a rule system to avoid having moderators in these group chats.
