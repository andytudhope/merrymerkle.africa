## Who is a Security Champion?

A person, who has interest in security and who commits his time to build
security culture and "security first" approach in the company.

Security champion is a role, it doesn't matter what background you have.

QAs, Developers, UXR, designers and managers can be security champions.

See "Learn More" for more details on it.


## So, now you are a Security Champion, what does it mean?

"Not compromising on security" is a part of the core values of Status. 
Security Champion role is very important, so don't hesitate to prioritize it
over your day-to-day activities!

### Your Responsibilities

- for new features/issues and PRs - mark them as "no security impact";

- ping the contributor to do a short threat modelling on new features that
 touch [sensitive data](./security_sensitive_data.md);

- review the threats and risk values;

- make sure that there are mitigation mechanisms in place for the most risks;

- participate in security-related decisions in the company;

- escalate security issues to `#security` channel if help is needed;

- participate in trainings and conferences related to the infosec;


## Stepping out of the role

Being a Security Champion might not suit a person. There is ok if after some
trial period you decide that it it not for you. You can always step out of the
role.

To do that, contact `@mandrigin` and we will discuss it from there. One thing
I will ask is to provide feedback why do you think it didn't work.
