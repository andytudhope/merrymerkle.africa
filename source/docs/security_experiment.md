title: Security Process Experiment
---

The Security Experiment consists of a Security Process and potentially a few
one-time projects, like retroactively threat-modeling the app and setting up
the security-related automation features.

This experiment starts in a limited amount of teams (pilot) and to be expanded
if successful.

## Objectives

- build security culture in the organization;

- implement "security first" approach to building our projects.

## Key Results

- Security Champions are identified;

- There is a security-related community in the organization;

- The projects are build using the best practices of secure development
(including automation);

- Each team has a security contact;

- All the new features get security & privacy assessments;
