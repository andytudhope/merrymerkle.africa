Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) is data that can be traced back 
to an individual and that, if disclosed, could result in harm to that person.
Such information includes biometric data, medical information, personally
identifiable financial information (PIFI) and unique identifiers such as
passport or Social Security numbers. 

Threats include not only crimes such as identity theft but also disclosure of personal information that the individual would prefer remained private. Sensitive PII should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
