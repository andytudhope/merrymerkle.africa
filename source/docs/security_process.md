# High-level overview

Security Process is based on the best practices recommended by
[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org).

The process is based on the practice called [Security Champions
2.0](./security_champions.md).

The idea is to have a person, called a Security Champion in each team and area.
This person is responsible for supporting security process in the particular
team and area as well as supporting security initiative throghout the
organization. 

The person doesn't have to have security background, but should be interested
in it.

Security champion works with the security community.
