# General information

Status uses HTTP server for debugging. By entering **Development mode** (on **Settings** screen) you start this server.
After that you're able to communicate to Status by sending HTTP requests. 

These document describes all possible requests and expected responses. All the examples here are given for HTTPie. 
Of course, you can use any other tool for HTTP communication instead.

# Technical details
* The server runs on port 5561;
* It runs only if **Development mode** (on **Settings** screen) is switched on
* Its settings are linked to your account — the server stops when you log out and starts when you log in;
* The content type for both requests and responses is always `application/json`.
